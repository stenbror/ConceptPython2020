This is a functional style parser for Python 3.9 research

Compared to my other parser in F# which is object oriented, this is a test of a functional style Tokenizer / Parser / AST system 
to implement a Roslyn like analyzer for Python programs with Trivia, Token and Node information that you can traverse yourself.

My two other projects is much the same in F# object oriented style and in C# to compare code size and resulting code size. Enjoy.
